# Faycal Zouine

**Senior ML Engineer** · Causal Inference · Measurement · Production ML Systems

Building statistical and machine learning systems that drive real business decisions.

Currently: Led Marketing Mix Modeling at Adobe, where I designed the Bayesian methodology used across 6 global markets to inform $250M+ in annual investment decisions.

## What I Do

I specialize in **applied machine learning for measurement and causal inference** — the systems that help companies understand what's actually working.

**Core expertise:**
- **Causal Inference & Incrementality** — Bayesian MMM, geo-experiments, synthetic control, diff-in-diff
- **Statistical Modeling** — Hierarchical Bayesian models (PyMC3/Stan), time-series forecasting (Prophet/ARIMA)
- **Production ML Systems** — End-to-end pipelines, model monitoring, automated retraining
- **Experimentation** — A/B testing frameworks, CUPED, sequential testing, power analysis
